            <h1>COMA</h1>
            <p>Release info: Following two acclaimed EPs on KOMPAKT and more than a year of meticulous preparation, COMAs (Marius Bubat and Georg Conrad) much-anticipated album debut IN TECHNICOLOR (KOMPAKT 279 CD 106) will see the light of day via KOMPAKT in April 2013. In advance of this incisive event, the band gives you a taste of the opulences to be expected with the 12 release of MY ORBIT (KOMPAKT 278) - one of the albums surefire highlights escorted by two brilliant remixes from upcoming luminaries DAUWD and CLOUDS. Laying out a richly adorned web of ridiculously catchy synth riffs, highly versatile beats and general leftfield extravaganza, IN TECHNICOLOR brings you two electronic producers very much willing to confide their sometimes unassertive perfectionism, now mutating into rackety, venturesome musicians before your very ears. Interstellar ballad MY ORBIT is but one of many wooing album moments tracing the impact pattern of the muses kisses, but it perfectly encapsulates the adventurous spirit exuded from COMA in 2013. A true pop epic at heart, this cut wanders a steepening path until it reaches its full-blown vocal climax sung by an android choir, happily veering off into glistening bleep disco territory shortly afterwards. COMA have never been shy of participating in the work of others or have them participate, as can be seen on IN TECHNICOLOR which is spiked with zealous guest performances from fellow artists running the whole gamut of contemporary pop culture. With this in mind, it shouldnt come as a surprise when the remixers of MY ORBIT turn out to be highly diversified producers exhibiting a similar thirst for sonic discovery. With DAUWD and CLOUDS, two upstarts hailing from UKs vast post-dubstep landscape enter the Kompakt stage, with the first one delivering a soulful, life-affirming reinterpretation steering close to the alluring original, while the second one revamps it into a sweaty, hard-hitting bass jam. Chock-full of beans, thats what we are. Tracklist: 1) My Orbit (Single Edit) 2) My Orbit (Dauwd Mix) 3) My Orbit (Clouds Mix) 4) My Orbit (Dauwd Instrumental Mix). <a href="https://pro.beatport.com/release/my-orbit/1060379" target="_blank">More</a></p>
            <h2>COMA - My Orbit</h2>
            <p>COMA is premiering a music video that also doubles as a trippy, TRON-esque video game. Designed by Philipp Carbotta, Hannes Hummel and Thilko Limbeck, the game allow users to interact with the glowing geometric shapes as "My Orbit" plays out.</p>
